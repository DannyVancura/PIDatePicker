## Description
A custom UIDatePicker object that allows design customization of various user interface attributes such as font, color, etc. This pod
aims to replicate the default UIDatePicker functionality while adding additional customization in the user interface.

## Usage

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory. 

## Installation

PIDatePicker is available through [Cocoapods](https://github.com/prolificinteractive/PIDatePicker). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

'''
pod "PIDatePicker", '~> 0.1.0'
'''

Because this project was written in Swift, your project must have a minimum target of iOS 8.0 or greater. Cocoapods
does not support Swift pods for previous iOS versions. If you need to use this on a previous version of iOS, 
import the code files directly into your project or by using git submodules.
